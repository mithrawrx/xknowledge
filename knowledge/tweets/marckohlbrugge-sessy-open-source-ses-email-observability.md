# Sessy

Open-source email observability for AWS SES by [Marc Köhlbrugge](https://x.com/marckohlbrugge).

## What is Sessy?

Amazon SES is a fantastic email service: cost-effective, reliable, and great deliverability. But it's frustratingly difficult to see what's actually happening with your emails.

That's why many people turn to overpriced email services that are often just glorified SES wrappers with a nice UI. You end up paying a lot for something you could do yourself.

Sessy is the open-source alternative. Use raw SES and still get a beautiful interface to see what happens after you hit send: deliveries, bounces, complaints, opens, clicks, and more.

## Running your own Sessy instance

The easiest way to run Sessy is with Docker:

```bash
docker run -p 80:80 \
  -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=$(openssl rand -hex 64) \
  -e DISABLE_SSL=true \
  -v sessy:/rails/storage \
  ghcr.io/marckohlbrugge/sessy:main
```

See [Docker deployment docs](docs/docker-deployment.md) for full configuration options.

Want to deploy your own modified version? See [Kamal deployment docs](docs/kamal-deployment.md) for deploying from a fork.

Using Dokku? See [Dokku deployment docs](docs/dokku-deployment.md).

## Jobs dashboard

Sessy uses [Solid Queue](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue) for background jobs. A web dashboard is available at `/jobs` to monitor queues, retry failed jobs, and view recurring tasks.

## Development

You are welcome to modify Sessy to your liking.

To get started:

```bash
bin/setup
bin/dev
```
